Galerucines are by far the most diverse subfamily of leaf beetles (chrysomelids). Two main groups are included in the subfamily: Skeletonizing Leaf Beetles (tribe Galerucini) and Flea Beetles (tribe Alticini).

Galerucines are everywhere! Distributed world-wide, they have an incredible variety of shapes and colors, and some species are considered important agricultural pests.

We want to assemble and annotate information about the biology, diversity and evolution of this group of leaf-beetles that, despite its incredible abundance, is not studied enough.
